      <p>
        Black bears are the only species of bear found in Shenandoah National
        Park. Shenandoah's bears make up 10-20% of Virginia's total bear
        population and occupy anywhere from 10 to 300 square miles. The bears
        tend to den in hollow trees and have a diet of insects, vegetation, and
        small mammals.

        Shenandoah Salamanders are an endangered species only found in
        Shenandoah National Park. They are lungless salamanders that breathe
        through their skin and require a certain level of skin moisture to
        survive. The salamanders are terrestrial and are typically found on high
        elevation peaks.
